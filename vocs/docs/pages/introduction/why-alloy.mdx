# Why Alloy?

Alloy is the next-generation Rust toolkit for Ethereum development and a complete rewrite of [ethers-rs](https://www.gakonst.com/ethers-rs/getting-started/intro.html). Alloy offers a modular, high-performance, and developer-friendly experience for building on EVM-compatible chains.
It addresses the various pain points of existing tooling in the Rust Ethereum ecosystem, such as perfomance bottlenecks, cumbersome APIs and having to deal with feature flag that bloat your application.

It provides a complete toolkit for Ethereum development in Rust:

- **Seamless smart contract interactions**: The `sol!` macro enables you to parse Solidity syntax directly in Rust code, simplifying contract interactions.

- **Simplified RPC Provider Usage**: Alloy enables you to connect to an EVM node in a simple and intuitive way.

- **Multi-Chain Support**: The `Network` trait allows seamless integration with any EVM-compatible chain without feature flags.

- **Layered Architecture**: Replaces monolithic middleware with composable layers and fillers, enhancing modularity and clarity.

- **Optimized Primitives**: Alloy's rewritten core components deliver major performance gains across key Ethereum operations such as ABI encoding/decoding, U256 operations, and RLP encoding and decoding:

Alloy is already powering major projects like [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), [Arbitrum Stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs), [OP Kona](https://github.com/op-rs/kona) and many more. It's designed to be the performant and stable foundation for the Rust Ethereum ecosystem.
