## Using the sol! macro

Alloy provides a powerful and intuitive way to read and write to contracts using the `sol!` procedural macro.

The sol! parses Solidity syntax to generate types that implement [alloy-sol-types](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/tree/main/crates/sol-types) traits.
It uses [`syn-solidity`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/tree/main/crates/syn-solidity), a [syn](https://github.com/dtolnay/syn)-powered Solidity parser.
It aims to mimic the behavior of the official Solidity compiler (`solc`) when it comes to parsing valid Solidity code. This means that all valid Solidity code, as recognized by `solc` `0.5.0` and above is supported.

In its most basic form `sol!` is used like this:

```rust showLineNumbers
use alloy::{primitives::U256, sol};

// Declare a Solidity type in standard Solidity
// [!code focus]
sol! { // [!code focus]
    // ... with attributes too!
    #[derive(Debug)] // [!code focus]
    struct Foo { // [!code focus]
        uint256 bar; // [!code focus]
        bool baz; // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
} // [!code focus]

// A corresponding Rust struct is generated:
// #[derive(Debug)]
// pub struct Foo {
//     pub bar: U256,
//     pub baz: bool,
// }

let foo = Foo { bar: U256::from(42), baz: true }; // [!code focus]
println!("{foo:#?}"); // [!code focus]
```

## Generate Rust Bindings

The sol! macro comes with the flexibilty of generating rust bindings for your contracts in multiple ways.

### Solidity

You can directly write Solidity code:

```rust
sol! {
    contract Counter {
        uint256 public number;

        function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
            number = newNumber;
        }

        function increment() public {
            number++;
        }
    }
}
```

Or provide a path to a Solidity file:

```rust
sol!(
    "artifacts/Counter.sol"
);
```

### JSON-ABI

By enabling the `json` feature, you can generate rust bindings from ABI compliant strings or abi files directly.

The format is either a JSON ABI array or an object containing an `"abi"` key. It supports common artifact formats like Foundry's:

Using an ABI file:

```rust
sol!(
    ICounter,
    "abi/Counter.json"
);
```

Using an ABI compliant string:

```rust
sol!(
   ICounter,
   r#"[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "increment",
            "inputs": [],
            "outputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
        },
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "number",
            "inputs": [],
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "name": "",
                    "type": "uint256",
                    "internalType": "uint256"
                }
            ],
            "stateMutability": "view"
        },
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "setNumber",
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "name": "newNumber",
                    "type": "uint256",
                    "internalType": "uint256"
                }
            ],
            "outputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
        }
   ]"#
);
```

### Snippets

At times, you don't want to generate for the complete contract to keep your project light but still want call one or two functions.
You can generate bindings for valid solidity snippets as well.

```rust
sol!(
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256[] memory amounts);
);

println!("Decoding https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd1b449d8b1552156957309bffb988924569de34fbf21b51e7af31070cc80fe9a");

let input = hex::decode("0x38ed173900000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a717cc0a3e4f84c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000283568400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0000000000000000000000000201f129111c60401630932d9f9811bd5b5fff34e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006227723d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000095ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce000000000000000000000000dac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7")?;

// Decode the input using the generated `swapExactTokensForTokens` bindings.
let decoded = swapExactTokensForTokensCall::abi_decode(&input);
```

### Forge bind

When working with large solidity projects it can be cumbersome to input your solidity code or ABI files into the `sol!` macro.

You can use the `forge bind` command from [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-bind) to generate alloy compatible rust bindings for your entire project or a selection of files.

You can learn more about the command and its various options [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-bind).

## Attributes

One can use the sol attributes to add additional functionality to the generated rust code.

For example, the `#[sol(rpc)]` attribute generates code to enable seamless interaction with the contract over the RPC provider.
It generates a method for each function in a contract that returns a [`CallBuilder`](https://docs.rs/alloy/latest/alloy/contract/struct.CallBuilder.html) for that function.

If `#[sol(bytecode = "0x...")]` is provided, the contract can be deployed with `Counter::deploy` and a new instance will be created.
The bytecode is also loaded from Foundry-style JSON artifact files.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/examples/deploy_from_contract.rs]
```

You can find a full list of attributes [here](https://docs.rs/alloy-sol-macro/latest/alloy_sol_macro/macro.sol.html#attributes).
