- [Contract and RPC codegen made cleaner by removal of the `T` transport generic](/migrating-to-core-1.0/sol!-changes/removing-T-generic)
- [Improving the function return types by removing the need for `_0`](/migrating-to-core-1.0/sol!-changes/improving-function-return-types)
- [Changes to function call bindings e.g `pub struct balanceOfCall { _0: Address }` to `pub struct balanceOfCall(pub Address)`](/migrating-to-core-1.0/sol!-changes/changes-to-function-call-bindings)
- [Changes to event bindings](/migrating-to-core-1.0/sol!-changes/changes-to-event-bindings)
- [Changes to error bindings](/migrating-to-core-1.0/sol!-changes/changes-to-error-bindings)

### Simplify ABI encoding and decoding

- [ABI encoding function return structs](/migrating-to-core-1.0/encoding-decoding-changes/encoding-return-structs)
- [Removing `validate: bool` from the `abi_decode` methods](/migrating-to-core-1.0/encoding-decoding-changes/removing-validate-bool)
